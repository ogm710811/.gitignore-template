# .gitignore-template
A .gitignore template for Windows 10, VS Code IDE, NodeJS, Environment, TypeScript, etc.

This is a .gitignore file template I use this list to populate the .gitignore file when creating new repositories and projects.

For more information about how .gitignore files work, and how to use them, the following resources are a great place to start:

- The [Ignoring Files chapter](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring) of the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. 
- The [Ignoring Files article](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) on the GitHub Help site.
- The [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) manual page.

# Contributing guidelines
I’d love for you to help me improve this project. Contributions will follow these guidelines.

Provide links to documentation supporting the change you’re making. Current, canonical documentation mentioning the files being ignored is best. If documentation isn’t available to support your change, do the best you can to explain what the files being ignored are for.

Explain why you’re making a change. Even if it seems self-evident, please take a sentence or two to tell why your change or addition should happen. It’s especially helpful to articulate why this change applies to everyone who works with the applicable technology, rather than just you or your team.

Please consider the scope of your change. If your change is specific to a certain language or framework, then make sure the change is made to the template for that language or framework, rather than to the template for an editor, tool, or operating system.

In general, the more you can do to help us understand the change you’re making, the more likely we’ll be to accept your contribution quickly.
